# Rancid Tomatillos | Week 14 | Paired project
**Overview:**
Rancid Tomatillos is a web application designed to view a collection of movies. This project was designed as our first React.js application to get experience using the React library as well as the React Router library.

## Technologies used
React.js | React Router |JavaScript | HTML | CSS

## Wins
A key achievement in our project was developing an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. We focused on making the UI user-friendly and engaging. To ensure the application looked and worked well across different devices, we implemented media queries for responsive design. This approach adjusted the UI for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and smartphones, improving accessibility and usability for a broader audience. Our efforts in UI design and responsive adaptation highlight our commitment to creating a practical and accessible application.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge in this project was the React learning curve, especially since it was our first time using it. Understanding React's component-based architecture and unidirectional data flow differed from traditional web development, requiring a mindset shift. Additionally, navigating best practices in React, such as component design and state management, involved filtering through tutorials and varied opinions. This led to a process of trial and error as we figured out what worked best for our project. Despite these challenges, our efforts deepened our React knowledge, setting a solid foundation for future development.

## Up Next 
Looking ahead, our next goal is to refine the application's user interface by implementing more conditional rendering. This strategy aims to enhance the user experience by preventing elements from abruptly appearing on the screen once the data fetch request completes. This approach will involve evaluating the current rendering logic and identifying opportunities to introduce conditional rendering in a way that elements are introduced more seamlessly into the UI. 

## Testing
We used Cypress to simulate user interactions to identify issues early. Cypress offers an end-to-end testing framework that allows us to test both happy and sad paths, ensuring our application behaves as expected under various conditions. This includes:

- Thorough testing of application views to ensure each page displays correctly.
- Comprehensive testing of user flows to confirm seamless navigation and functionality.
- Making specific assertions about the content within DOM elements to verify accurate rendering of information.
- Properly stubbing network requests to test interactions with external APIs without reliance on live data.
- Stubbing and testing asynchronous functionality to ensure both expected (happy path) and unexpected (sad path) outcomes are handled correctly.

Our testing approach, emphasizing coverage of both existing and new features, aligns with our objectives of mastering React and creating an intuitive user experience with Router.
